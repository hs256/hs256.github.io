We also built a novel failure model using historical failure data. Using data from Microsoft WAN and Exchange application, we show network capacity savings of upto 40% and projected savings of 200 million dollars. We also collaborated with Azure Networking to deploy our solution in production.

The SEE (symbolic execution engine) was written in C++ and used Z3 to solve constraints and generate counter packet traffic. The code can be found here (https://github.com/hs256/NFSE). Important usecases include PAN firewall, rate limiter, SYN flood detector, and heavy hitter detector.

                                | Netfilter linux kernel module and iptables/nftables allow tracking connections by storing state information of flows in memory tables, such as source and destination address, port number, protocol types, and default timeout. However, attacker can initiate a large number of connections of a particular protocol type with higher timeout value which would exhaust the memory table. In this work, we added support to add custom timeout values for different protocols in the user-facing tool nftables, library libnftnl and Netfilter modeule of linux kernel.
