I am a junior year student pursuing Bachelors in Technology in Engineering Physics at Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, Uttarakhand.

Interests:

My main fields of interest are operating systems, network security, virtualization systems, computer architecture and compiler design.
I am interested in making computer and network systems more secure, reliable and efficient.

I have experience of working as a research intern at Chair of Operating Systems, Technical University of Munich, where I worked on Checkpoint and Restore Project in Genode framework and L4 Fiasco microkernel.

I was a Google Summer of Code student with Netfilter (Linux Kernel Network Firewalling) organisation, where my major project was to implement connection tracking timeout policies in netfilter. I also presented this work in Netfilter Conference 2018, Berlin.

I had also worked as a linux kernel intern with outreachy in round 14. I'm an active open-source contributor in linux kernel and linux kernel related projects.

I'm an active member at Software Development Section (SDSLabs), and associated with InfosecIITR group and also a member of Choreography and Dance Section at IIT Roorkee.
SDSLabs is a technical group which strives to take further the tech culture at our campus through its innovations and initiatives.
