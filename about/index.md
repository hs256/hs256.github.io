I am a sophomore student pursuing Bachelors in Technology in Engineering Physics in Indian Institute of Technology, Roorkee, Uttarakhand.

Interests:

Computer Science: My keen interset lies in web development, information security, network security and operating system development. I have always been a tech enthusiast and have been exploring fields like binary exploitation, reverse engineering, web application security and linux-kernel development. Open source is one of my recent interests.

Physics: I am mainly interested in theoritical physics and quantum mechanics is my recent field of interest.

Entertainment: I absolutely love dancing, travelling and listening to music of all genres. There is much more to know about it.

I'm an active member at Software Development Section (SDSLabs), and associated with InfosecIITR group and also a member of Choreography and Dance Section at IIT Roorkee.
SDSLabs is a technical group which strives to take further the tech culture at our campus through its innovations and initiatives.
