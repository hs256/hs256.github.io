I am a research fellow at [Microsoft Research India](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-india/) where I work with [Venkat Padmanabhan](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/padmanab/) and [Ranjita Bhagwan](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/bhagwan/) on optimizing Microsoft's Wide Area Network. 

Prior to this, I obtained my bachelors from [Indian Institute of Technology Roorkee](https://www.iitr.ac.in/) with majors in Engineering physics.
